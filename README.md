# Issue: [Nuxt Bridge](https://nuxt.com/docs/bridge/overview) fails to run or build

I stumbled upon the bug reported in https://github.com/nuxt/bridge/issues/1469

This repo contains a minimal Nuxt 2 application with `nuxt-bridge` and the following config:

```js
import { defineNuxtConfig } from '@nuxt/bridge'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false,
  bridge: {
    vite: true,
    nitro: true
  }
});
```

And these scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxi dev",
  "build": "nuxi build",
  "start": "nuxi preview"
},
```

When running `yarn dev`, I get the following error related to `unenv/dist/runtime/runtime/mock/proxy.mjs`:

```
[nitro 11:51:24 AM]  ERROR  Error: Could not load /Users/dev/Sites/test/bridging/node_modules/unenv/dist/runtime/runtime/mock/proxy.mjs (imported by node_modules/nitropack/dist/runtime/internal/error/dev.mjs): ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/Users/dev/Sites/test/bridging/node_modules/unenv/dist/runtime/runtime/mock/proxy.mjs'
```

Looks like nitropack is trying to import or use `unenv/dist/runtime/runtime/mock/proxy.mjs`, but note the double `runtime` in the path.

That file is in fact in `unenv/dist/runtime/mock/proxy.mjs`.

When I try to `yarn build`, I get the same error:

## Turning off Nuxt Bridge works

If you check out the [bridge-off]([url](https://github.com/nicodevs/bridging/tree/bridge-off)) branch of this repo, you will find this config:

```js
import { defineNuxtConfig } from '@nuxt/bridge'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: false,
  bridge: false
});
```

And these scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "nuxt2 dev",
  "build": "nuxt2 build",
  "start": "nuxt2 preview"
},
```

Then, the app works. The issue only appears when turning on any option of `bridge`.
